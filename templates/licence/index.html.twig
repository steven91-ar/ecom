        <h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
        <h2>Version 3, 29 June 2007</h2>
        <p>&copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org">https://fsf.org</a>&gt;</p>
        <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
            allowed.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.</p>
        <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
            change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
            and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
            Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
            other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
        <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
            designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
            if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
            use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
        <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender
            the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
            modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
        <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the
            recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
            source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
        <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and
            (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
        <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free
            software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed,
            so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
        <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside
            them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
            users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products
            for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
            version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in
            other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
            needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
        <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to
            restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
            avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To
            prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
        <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

        <h3>0. Definitions.</h3>
        <p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
        <p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
        </p>
        <p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as
            “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
        <p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright
            permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
            earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
        <p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.</p>
        <p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or
            secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
            modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
            available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
        <p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere
            interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
        <p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a
            convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
            the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
            licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
            presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
            criterion.</p>

        <h3>1. Source Code.</h3>
        <p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object
            code” means any non-source form of a work.</p>
        <p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
            standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
            widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
        <p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is
            included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
            and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
            Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”,
            in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
            operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
            object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
        <p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate,
            install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
            control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools
            or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
            not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with
            source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that
            the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between
            those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
        <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts
            of the Corresponding Source.</p>
        <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
        <h2>7. Ajouts</h2>
        <p>
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source
            files, a
            statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
            applicable terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license,
            or stated as
            exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Termination.</h2>
        <p>
            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
            otherwise to
            propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
            any patent
            licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated
            (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and
            (b)
            permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
            60 days
            after the cessation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
            notifies you
            of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of
            this License
            (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of
            the notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
            copies or
            rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you
            do not
            qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h2>
        <p>
            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
            propagation of a
            covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise
            does not
            require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
            any covered
            work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
            propagating a
            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h2>
        <p>
            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
            licensors, to run,
            modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
            third
            parties with this License.
        </p>
        <p>
            An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
            assets of one, or
            subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an
            entity
            transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses
            to the work
            the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
            possession of the
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
            with
            reasonable efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
            License. For
            example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
            this License,
            and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
            patent
            claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of
            it.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Patents.</h2>
        <p>
            A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on
            which the
            Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
        </p>
        <p>
            A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,
            whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of
            making, using, or
            selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
            further
            modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to
            grant patent
            sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's
            essential
            patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
            contents of its
            contributor version.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however
            denominated, not
            to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
            infringement).
            To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
            patent
            against the party.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the
            work is not
            available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
            available network
            server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
            available, or
            (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
            arrange, in a
            manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
            recipients.
            “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
            covered work in
            a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
            patents in
            that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        </p>
        <p>
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by
            procuring
            conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
            authorizing
            them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you
            grant is
            automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
            exercise of,
            or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this
            License. You
            may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
            business of
            distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity
            of conveying
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
            from you, a
            discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
            made from
            those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain
            the covered
            work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to
            infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        </p>

        <h2>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h2>
        <p>
            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
            conditions of this
            License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so
            as to
            satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
            consequence
            you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
            further
            conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and
            this License
            would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h2>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you may incorporate a covered work into a larger
            program
            containing proprietary components if you have made a good faith effort to allow users to access the
            Corresponding Source
            of the covered work as required by this License, and if you provide access to that Corresponding Source in a
            reasonable
            manner to the recipients of the larger program. If you do not comply with this requirement, you must, as a
            consequence, cease all conveying of the larger program. This requirement is in addition to your obligations
            under any
            other license, including but not limited to the GNU Affero General Public License, under which you may
            operate.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Future Versions of this License.</h2>
        <p>
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from
            time to time.
            Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
            problems or
            concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered
            version of the
            GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
            and
            conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software
            Foundation. If the
            Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever
            published
            by the Free Software Foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h2>
        <p>
            There is no warranty for the Program, except that the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the
            Program
            “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
            implied
            warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
            performance of
            the Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
            repair or
            correction.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Limitation of Liability.</h2>
        <p>
            In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any
            other party
            who modifies and/or conveys the Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
            incidental or
            consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to
            loss of data
            or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to
            operate
            with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
            damages.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h2>
        <p>
            If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local effect
            according to
            their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely matches the intent of the original
            disclaimer and
            limitation.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Acknowledgement of Sponsorship.</h2>
